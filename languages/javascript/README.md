### for a while will be empty, i'm mainly learning JS now and most of my progress is being sent to [this repo](https://github.com/Gabriel-Marino/freeCodeCamp---JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)


```JavaScript
/**
 * JavaScript primitives:
 * - number
 * - string
 * - boolean
 * - null
 * - undefined
 * - symbol
 * - object
 */

/**
 * Objects are used to store data in a structured way, they are used to store data in a way that is easy to access, and that is easy to modify
 * They work like arrays, but they uses keywords instead of indexes and they are more flexible, they can store data in different ways, and they can store functions
 * You can declare an object with {} or with new Object()
 * You can access the properties of an object with ., and you can access the values of the properties with []
 * Objects are mutable, they can be changed, and they can be added to
 * You can add properties to an object with .setProperty(key, value)
 * You can remove properties from an object with .removeProperty(key)
 * You can check if a property exists in an object with .hasProperty(key)
 * You can get the number of properties in an object with .getPropertyCount()
 * You can get the keys of an object with .getPropertyKeys()
 * You can get the values of an object with .getPropertyValues()
 * Objects are not ordered, they can be accessed in any order, they can not be used with for...of, they can not be used with for...in, they can not be used with forEach(), they can not be used with map(), they can not be used with filter(), they can not be used with reduce(), they can not be used with every(), they can not be used with some(), they can not be used with find(), they can not be used with findIndex(), they can not be used with sort(), they can not be used with reverse(), they can not be used with slice(), they can not be used with splice(), they can not be used with concat(), they can not be used with join(), they can not be used with push(), they can not be used with pop(), they can not be used with unshift(), they can not be used with shift(), they can not be used with indexOf(), they can not be used with lastIndexOf()
