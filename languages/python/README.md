string1 = "Hello World" # This is a string

string3 = "" # This is a string too, and normally when you don't know what value a variable will have, you can declare them with an empty string if the variable will have a string value.

arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # This is an array
arr2 = [] # This is an array too, and like for strings, if you want an array but don't know what value it will have, you can declare it with an empty array.

number = 1 # This is a number

tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # This is a tuple

dictonary = {} # This is a dictionary
